            <p>
            Born in Mar del Plata, a coastal town in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, my family migrated us to the United States when I was 6 years old. 
            I was raised in the Washington-Metropolitan area, growing up in Montgomery County, Maryland. Currently, I reside in the Detroit-Metropolitan area where I am enrolled in a 
            rigorous and fast-paced bootcamp focused on Full Stack Web Development. 
            Since I was young, I've always enjoyed creating art and working on puzzles. Life has taught me to utilize my creativity as an advantage, allowing me to solve complex problems with 
            unique solutions that are flexible and adaptable to any challenge presented.
